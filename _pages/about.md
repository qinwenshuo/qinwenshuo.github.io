Hi! I am a Research Coordinator at Johns Hopkins University, where I am mentored by Prof. [Leyla Isik](https://www.isiklab.org/people-1). My research broadly focuses on computational models of social cognition, with an emphasis on identifying the inductive biases required for AI systems to align with human social perception. In my prior work, I demonstrated that relational and 3D representations play a critical role in enabling models to recognize social interactions in a human-like manner.

Before joining Johns Hopkins, I earned a B.S. in Neuroscience and a B.S. in Computer Science from Boston College. I worked under the mentorship of Prof. [Joshua Hartshorne](https://ai4commsci.github.io/JKHartshorne.About.html), where I applied contrastive learning methods to study how first-language linguistic features shape second-language acquisition.

Outside of research, I enjoy playing video games 🎮, watching movies 🎬, hiking 🚶, golfing ⛳️, and ice skating ⛸️.
